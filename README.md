# JavaScript Password Generator

This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

**password criteria**:
 - Length (between 8 and 128 characters)
 - Character types: Special characters, Numeric characters, Lowercase characters & Uppercase characters
 
 The application validates the user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected. The user also has the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard. The application is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
